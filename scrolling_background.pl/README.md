### scrolling_background.pl

An example, how to move the background in SDLx.

Translation of [https://github.com/hlubenow/pygame_experiments/tree/main/scrolling_background.py](my similar Pygame script).

SDLx scrolls actually quite smooth, though not perfectly either. But for sure good enough for nice games.

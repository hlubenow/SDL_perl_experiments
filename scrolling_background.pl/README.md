### scrolling_background.pl

An example, how to move the background in SDLx.

Translation of [my similar script in Python/Pygame](https://github.com/hlubenow/pygame_experiments/tree/main/scrolling_background.py). You can read in the link what this is all about.

SDLx scrolls actually quite nicely (I'd say a bit better than Pygame), though not perfectly either. But sure good enough for nice games.

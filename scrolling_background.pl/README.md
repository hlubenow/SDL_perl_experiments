### scrolling_background.pl

An example, how to move the background in SDLx.

Translation of [my similar Python/Pygame script](https://github.com/hlubenow/pygame_experiments/tree/main/scrolling_background.py).

SDLx scrolls actually quite nicely, though not perfectly either. But sure good enough for nice games.
